Filet mignon is another luxurious cut of steak known for its tenderness and soft texture. This comes from a cows tenderloin which consists of other muscles shown in the picture above. As noted it is known for its texture and tenderness however its beef flavor is not as strong as something like a ribeye.

Because of its flavor profile being weaker than other cuts and it being known for its tenderness most people only use it for steak or for Beef Wellingtons. I am not familiar enough with beef wellington to instruct you on how to make it, but it is very popular and easy to find.

When looking to buy a filet mignon it is most cost effective to buy the whole tenderloin and butcher the cut yourself. By doing so you save money by doing the work yourself and buying in bulk and you can repurpose the other cuts of meat.
