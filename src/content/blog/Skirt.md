By far my favorite cut of steak is skirt steak. It has a strong beefy flavor low fat content. This makes it a great choice if you are on a diet or wanting to watch out for eating too much fat but still want a good steak.

Skirt steak is incredibly versatile; allowing you to cook it like a normal steak or put it in tacos or a stir fry. The only hard part about cooking skirt steak is how thin it is. Because it is so thin, oftentimes you only need to cook it for 4-5 minutes. Any longer and you'll over cook it.

To buy one just ensure that it looks fresh! Not much else you need to worry about since it is just one muscle.
