Another amazing cut of steak that does well when traditionally grilled or pan fried. You can typically cook this cut like a ribeye due to it having similar properties in thickness and fat cap. Only other thing to add is that it would be good to sear the fat cap at the beginning to render out some of that fat.

Coming from the loin of a cow it sits above the filet mignon. Not much else to say other than it is a great steak that isn't too expensive.
