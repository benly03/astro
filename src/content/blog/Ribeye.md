Ribeye is one of the most luxurious cuts of steak. It's comprised of two muscles from the cow's ribs; the rib eye whcih is the center of the cut then there's the rib cap which surrounds the rib eye. The rib cap is highly revered to be the best tasting part of the steak since it has a high fat content and strong beef flavor. 

Considering that the steak is so expensive, most people would eat this like a normal steak. Pan seared and cut up eaten commonly with sides like mashed potatoes, asparagus, corn, or brussel sprouts. Although, cooking a ribeye like a normal steak is great way to eat it, it is ultimately an incredibly versatile cut that can be used in marinades, soup, stews, roasts, etc.

Now that you know how to cook it and what to do with it, how would you buy one? My best advice would be to look for steaks with good marbling, thin fat lines going through the steak, and a large rib cap and small fat cap. This gives you a steak that is tender without the large fat areas.
